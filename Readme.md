# LangChain Summarization Project
A project to master LangChain through structured tasks.
Contributor: - Rooman

Task-1:
This task loads environment variables from a .env file using the dotenv library, retrieves Azure OpenAI configuration values (API key, endpoint, deployment name, and API version) from the environment, and prints them to the console.

Task-2:
This task imports two utility functions: one to configure an OpenAI language model and another to build a text summarizer. It sets up the language model, defines a passage about artificial intelligence, and creates two summarizersâ€”one for a three-sentence summary and one for a single-sentence summary. It then prints both summaries of the AI passage using the respective summarizers.
