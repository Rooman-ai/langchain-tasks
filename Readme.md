# LangChain Summarization Project
A project to master LangChain through structured tasks.
Contributor: - Rooman

Task-1:
This task loads environment variables from a .env file using the dotenv library, retrieves Azure OpenAI configuration values (API key, endpoint, deployment name, and API version) from the environment, and prints them to the console.

Task-2:
This task imports two utility functions: one to configure an OpenAI language model and another to build a text summarizer. It sets up the language model, defines a passage about artificial intelligence, and creates two summarizersâ€”one for a three-sentence summary and one for a single-sentence summary. It then prints both summaries of the AI passage using the respective summarizers.

Task-3:
This task loads a text file about AI, splits it into chunks, and stores their embeddings for retrieval. It then queries the vector store for text relevant to "AI milestones," summarizes the retrieved text into three sentences and one sentence using an LLM-based summarizer, and prints both summaries.
