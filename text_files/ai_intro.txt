The history of artificial intelligence (AI) dates back to ancient myths and stories of artificial beings brought to life, but its scientific foundations began in the mid-20th century. In 1950, Alan Turing proposed the famous “Turing Test,” suggesting that if a machine could converse indistinguishably from a human, it might be considered intelligent. This thought experiment laid the groundwork for a new field. A few years later, in 1956, the Dartmouth Conference, organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, officially marked the birth of AI as an academic discipline. Researchers at the conference believed that human intelligence could be simulated and that progress could be rapid. Early enthusiasm was high, and programs like Logic Theorist and General Problem Solver showed that computers could perform symbolic reasoning.

The 1960s and 1970s saw expansion in AI research, with funding from governments and universities. Work on natural language processing, robotics, and game playing became popular. Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA, developed in the 1960s, simulated a psychotherapist and fascinated the public. However, limitations in computing power and the difficulty of solving real-world problems soon became apparent. Optimism gave way to disappointment, leading to what became known as the “AI Winter.” During these periods of reduced funding and interest, progress slowed, but researchers continued to make incremental advances.

In the 1980s, AI experienced a revival with the rise of expert systems. These programs encoded specialized knowledge into rules that could be applied to specific problems, such as medical diagnosis or industrial troubleshooting. One famous example was MYCIN, which assisted doctors in identifying bacterial infections. Expert systems demonstrated commercial value, attracting corporate investment. However, they were brittle—unable to adapt outside their narrow domain—and eventually interest declined again.

The 1990s brought new momentum with advances in machine learning, an approach that focused on enabling computers to learn from data rather than relying solely on hand-crafted rules. Statistical methods, support vector machines, and decision trees became important tools. IBM’s Deep Blue, which defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, showcased the potential of combining computational power with clever algorithms. Around the same time, progress in speech recognition and early applications of neural networks began to resurface.

The 2000s and 2010s marked the rise of modern AI driven by deep learning. Inspired by the structure of the human brain, artificial neural networks had been studied for decades, but only with the availability of massive datasets and powerful GPUs did they achieve breakthrough results. Convolutional neural networks revolutionized image recognition, while recurrent neural networks and transformers advanced natural language processing. In 2012, a deep learning system developed by Geoffrey Hinton’s team won the ImageNet competition by a large margin, sparking global interest. Google’s AlphaGo defeated Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016, highlighting the ability of AI to master tasks once thought uniquely human.

Today, AI is embedded in everyday life, from recommendation systems and voice assistants to autonomous vehicles and medical imaging. Research continues to expand, exploring reinforcement learning, generative models, and ethical considerations. The history of AI reflects cycles of optimism, setbacks, and resurgence, but each milestone builds upon earlier efforts. From ancient myths to cutting-edge deep learning, the pursuit of artificial intelligence continues to shape technology and society.
